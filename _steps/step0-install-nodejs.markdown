You can download the Node.js installer from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>  

Download it, run it and follow the prompts.

There are installers for Windows, macOS & Linux.  Linux users should check if their distro includes a Node.js package for easy installation.

The most recent version of Node.js at time of writing is 8.  However any release of 6 or greater should work fine.

Once Node.js is installed, open a terminal and enter the command `node --version` to verify that it is installed correctly.
