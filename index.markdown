Welcome to Javascript.

We are going to assume the following about you:

 - you know some basic HTML/CSS and can make simple webpages
 - you know the basics of using a text editor like Atom, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text etc.

If you arenâ€™t familiar with those things you should start with [Introduction to HTML](/learn-html) first.

This workshop aims to teach you the basics of building a website as a server-side application using NodeJS.



## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is everywhere these days.  In addition to being built into the browser, Node.JS has made it possible to do server-side, desktop, and even robotics programming in Javascript as well.  

So now you can write your backend services in Javascript, your website frontend  in Javascript, desktop tools, and automation as well.

The future is obviously written in Javascript, so the better question is: Why not Javascript?
