# Introduction to Node.js workshop.

Welcome to the **Muses Code Introduction to Node.js** workshop.

In this workshop you are going to build a simple server-side web site.  

The site we will build is based on the Tiny Cakes website from the [Learn HTML](/learn-html) workshop but we will add some content management features to it.

We are going to assume the following about you:

 - you know some basic HTML/CSS and can make simple webpages
 - you know the basics of using a text editor like Atom, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text etc.

If you arenâ€™t familiar with those things we suggest starting with our [Learn HTML](/learn-html) workshop first.

### Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is everywhere these days.  In addition to being built into the browser, Node.JS has made it possible to do server-side, desktop, and even robotics programming in Javascript as well.  

So now you can write your backend services in Javascript, your website frontend  in Javascript, desktop tools, and automation as well.

The future is obviously written in Javascript, so the better question is: Why not Javascript?
